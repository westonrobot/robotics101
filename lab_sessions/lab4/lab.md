# Prelab (1%)
## Before lab
1. Find and bring a STL model(s) you would like to import during the lab.

## Start of Lab
1. We will have a short MCQ quiz on concepts that have been covered in the lecture and those that will be needed during this lab session, concepts covered will be from the readings found below.

## Readings
1. [Limo - Lidar Mapping](https://github.com/agilexrobotics/limo-doc/blob/master/Limo%20user%20manual(EN).md#5-lidar-mapping)
2. [Limo - Lidar Navigation](https://github.com/agilexrobotics/limo-doc/blob/master/Limo%20user%20manual(EN).md#6-lidar-navigation)
3. [TF - tf2 Overview](http://wiki.ros.org/tf2/Tutorials)
4. [ROS Navigation - Setup](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup)
5. [Gazebo - ROS Integration](https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_overview)

## Materials
1. [YDLidar - ROS package](https://github.com/YDLIDAR/ydlidar_ros)

# Setup
* Be in your teams of 5
* Tasks & report should be performed by all **group members individually** unless told otherwise.

## Lab Report and Submission
* Throughout this lab, there are tasks that you are supposed to perform and record observations/deductions.
* You can share common experimental data, but not explanations, code or deductions for the lab report.
* Discrepancies between report results and code submissions are liable for loss of marks.
* Each task will be clearly labelled and will need to be included in your lab report, which is in the format "**lab4\_report\_<STUDENT\_ID>.doc / pdf**", include your name, student_id at the begining of the report.
* Zip up your lab report and other requirements (if present) and name it "**lab4\_<STUDENT\_ID>.zip**" and upload it.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of lab 4, you will have:
1. learnt how to create your own gazebo simulation world
2. learnt how to integrate your gazebo world into ROS
3. learnt how to perform mapping of your simulation world
