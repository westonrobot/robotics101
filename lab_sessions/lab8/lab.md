## Readings

## Materials

# Setup
* Be in your teams of 5
* Tasks & report should be performed by all **group members individually** unless told otherwise.

## Lab Report and Submission
* Throughout this lab, there are tasks that you are supposed to perform and record observations/deductions.
* You can share common experimental data, but not explanations, code or deductions for the lab report.
* Discrepancies between report results and code submissions are liable for loss of marks.
* Each task will be clearly labelled and will need to be included in your lab report, which is in the format "**lab8\_report\_<STUDENT\_ID>.doc / pdf**", include your name, student_id at the beginning of the report.
* Zip up your lab report and other requirements (if present) and name it "**lab8\_report\_<STUDENT\_ID>.doc / pdf**" and upload it.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of lab 8, you will have:
1. Learnt how to create a object detection dataset using labeling tools
2. Learnt how to train/deploy a object detection model
3. Experience common tools/framework to do so (Pytorch, Roboflow, YOLOv6)
