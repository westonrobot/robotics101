# **Lecture 2: Python & ROS basics**
* Mon, May 17, 9:00 am â€“ 13:00 am

## **Overview**

Week 2's lecture will provide a a quick crash course on python2 basics and ROS melodic development.

This lecture will cover the fundamental basics of python and ROS, meant to serve as a foundation with which students can built on and expand.

While the concepts covered are non-exhaustive by any means, it should cover most (if not all) that a student will need during the duration of the course. With that in mind, students are still encouraged to explore more advanced concepts to broaden what they are able to do in the their projects and learn/experience what Python/ROS development can be like.

Further information regarding week 2's prelab and lab will be provided during the lecture.
