# **Lecture 4 - Gazebo & ROS Navigation (Mapping)**
* Mon, May 30, 9:00 am â€“ 13:00 am

## **Overview**

Week 4's lecture will provide a overview on Gazebo worlds, simulations and ROS integration and beginning our look into ROS navigation stack.

While the concepts covered are non-exhaustive by any means, it should cover most (if not all) that a student will need during the duration of the course. With that in mind, students are still encouraged to explore more advanced concepts to broaden what they are able to do in the their projects.

Further information regarding week 4's prelab and lab will be provided during the lecture.
