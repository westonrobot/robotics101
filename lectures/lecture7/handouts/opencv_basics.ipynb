While this notebook covers most of what you would need in a basic computer vision project, the concepts covered here are non-exhaustive. OpenCV is an open source library that provides a commmon infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in commercial products. "

    "To read an image using the OpenCV library in python, we will need to these libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numpy Library : The computer processes images in the form of a matrix for which NumPy is used and  OpenCV uses it in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "* OpenCV python : OpenCV library previously it was cv but the updated version is cv2. It is used to manipulate images and videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To read the images **cv2.imread()** function is used.\n",
    "    * Syntax: cv2.imread(path, flag)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Parameters:\n",
    "        * path: A string representing the path of the image to be read.\n",
    "\n",
    "        * flag: It specifies the way in which image should be read. Itâ€™s default value is cv2.IMREAD_COLOR  \n",
    "            * cv.IMREAD_COLOR : Loads a color image. Any transparency of image will be neglected. It is the default flag. Can be replaced with integer value 1.\n",
    "            * cv.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE : Loads image in grayscale mode. Can be replaced with integer value 0.\n",
    "            * cv.IMREAD_UNCHANGED : Loads image as such including alpha channel. Can be replaced with integer value -1.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Return Value: This method returns an image that is loaded from the specified file path."
