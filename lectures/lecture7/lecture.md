# **Lecture 7 - Introduction to Computer Vision with OpenCV**

- Monday, 9:00 am â€“ 1:00 pm

## **Overview**

Week 7's lecture will provide a overview on Computer Vision, OpenCV and PID Control.

- Computer Vision
  - Basic Element on Computer Vision
  - 2D VS 3D Computer Vision
  - Mono and Stereo Cameras
  - Colour Spaces used in Computer Vision
    - RGB, BGR
    - HSV and HSL
  - Typical applications in Robotics

- OpenCV
  - Overview on what is OpenCV
  - OpenCV basics and examples in Jupyter

- PID Control
  - PID Application
  - Types of Feedback control
    - Bang Bang Control
    - PID Control
  - How P,I and D controls aid in moving a robot to its desired path



While the concepts covered are non-exhaustive by any means, it should cover most (if not all) that a student will need during the duration of the course. With that in mind, students are still encouraged to explore more advanced concepts to broaden what they are able to do in the their projects.

Further information regarding week 7's prelab and lab will be provided during the lecture.
