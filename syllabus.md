### Objectives 

This course is primarily designed for students who are new to robotics but want to get a quick
exposure to various aspects of robotics development, including hardware, ROS, autonomous navigation,
computer vision and machine learning, etc. It covers the industry best tools, workflows and practices,
and bridges the gaps between academia courses and solutions to practical challenges in robot and robotics
application development.

### Prerequisites

A basic understanding of electronics, computer network and programming is assumed.
Hands-on experience with CAD tools and 3D printing is also required.

### Office Hours

After class, or by appointment, or post your questions in the forum provided for this purpose.

### Grading Policy

* Labs (50%): 8 graded lab sessions, each worth 4-8%
* Final project (50%): demonstration (25%), presentation (15%), report (10%)

### Class Policy

Regular attendance of both the lectures and lab sessions are essential and expected.

### Academic Honesty

Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation
for a violation.

### Tentative Schedule

You can find the course schedule on [this page](schedule.md).
